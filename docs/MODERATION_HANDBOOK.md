# Internal Moderation Handbook

This document provides guidelines for the moderation team to ensure consistent, fair, and efficient review of all user-submitted content.

## 1. The Moderation Process
1.  **Review New Submissions:** All new content submissions appear in the "Pending Submissions" queue in the moderation panel.
2.  **Review Reports:** All user-submitted reports appear in the "Pending Reports" queue.
3.  **Take Action:** For each item, a moderator must decide to either `Approve`, `Reject`, or `Dismiss` (for reports).

## 2. Approval Criteria
A submission should be **approved** if it meets all the following criteria:
- It adheres to all rules in the public `CONTENT_STANDARDS.md`.
- **Title & Description:** The title and description are clear, free of typos, and accurately represent the content.
- **Video Quality:** The video is watchable and the audio is clear. Minor imperfections are acceptable.
- **Educational Merit:** The content has a clear educational purpose and is not just an opinion piece or vlog.

## 3. Rejection Criteria & Canned Responses
A submission should be **rejected** if it violates any of the approval criteria. When rejecting, please use one of the following reasons to provide feedback to the creator.

- **`REASON: INACCURATE`**: The content contains factual errors that could mislead learners.
- **`REASON: LOW_QUALITY`**: The audio or video quality is too poor to provide a good learning experience (e.g., inaudible, shaky camera).
- **`REASON: PROHIBITED`**: The content violates our Prohibited Content policy (e.g., hate speech, harassment). *Note: Escalate these cases to a senior moderator.*
- **`REASON: COPYRIGHT`**: The content appears to use copyrighted material without permission.
- **`REASON: UNCLEAR`**: The educational purpose of the content is not clear, or the title/description is misleading.

## 4. Handling User Reports
1.  **Review the reported content** against the user's reason and our Content Standards.
2.  **If the report is valid:** Take action on the content (e.g., remove the content, warn the user).
3.  **If the report is invalid:** Dismiss the report. No action is needed against the content or the original creator.
